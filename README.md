This study, titled "Tech HQ Ripple Effect: Real Estate Price Trends in the Bay Area" aims to bridge the knowledge gap by analyzing the impact of proximity to tech company
headquarters on housing demand and property prices. By examining both micro-level factors (e.g., property size, number of bedrooms, number of storeys, and walkability) and
macro-level influences (e.g., seasonal trends, economic shifts), the project seeks to provide actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and residents. The findings will
empower stakeholders to make informed decisions in this competitive and rapidly evolving market.
